    Delaunay Six

This program computes the list of all 6241 combinatorial types of
Delaunay polytopes in dimension six. See below the data

dimension     Author          Nr of types
2             Fedorov         2
3             Fedorov         5

The last version of this program is available from
http://drobilica.irb.hr/~mathieu/

This program use:

the "dreadnaut" program from the nauty package 
http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/

the "gap" computer algebra program
http://www.gap-system.org/

Both gap.sh and dreadnaut should be available from the command line.
Also perl should be in /usr/bin/perl

This program computes the list of all 6241 combinatorial types of
Delaunay polytopes in dimension six.

   HOW TO RUN THE ENUMERATION (on linux)

Extract the archive
tar -vxzf DelaunaySix.tar.gz

Go into the archive
cd DelaunaySix

run the program by
./RUN_ENUMERATION

   HOW TO GET THE DATAS

In the directory RESULT should appear after 2 or more days of
computations (depending of the processing power of your
computer) the files CorankXWithSchlafli and CorankXWithoutSchlafli
with X varying between 1 and 20.
the simplex correspond to X=0 and is not included.

The file RESULT/Maximal present the few maximal Delaunay polytopes
found.

   TODO

The whole enumeration take as granted that we know the list of
3773 facets and 37170 extreme rays of the hypermetric cone HYP7. 

Those lists were actually computed by Baranovskii and M.Dutour.
At present they are in the directory WORK-PERM but they should
be generated at the beginning of the computation.
